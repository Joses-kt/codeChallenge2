Description

1. caseSwap.js
This is a function that is used to identify the case of each letter in a string and swapping it to the opposite case.

Concepts used for this code are:

Prompt- A javascript method that displays a dialog box to input the user's data.
A for loop- loops through the characters in a given string,
IF -ELSE Statement that checks the current case of the character
toUpperCase and toLowerCase are inbuilt methods that perform case swap on the passes character.

2. arrayGenerator.js
The code takes in two numbers and generates an array of all the numbers between the two given ones.

Concepts used for this code are:

Prompt- A javascript method that displays a dialog box for inputting the user's data.

ParseInt - converts user input to number data type

For loop: loops through numbers from the starting number to the last number with an increment or decrement of 1 pushing the numbers into a new array.

The generateArray function returns a new array of numbers.

3. The code takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array that contains only the prime numbers.

Concepts for the code are:

Prompt- A javascript method that displays a dialog box for inputting the user's data.

ParseInt - converts user input to number data type
.split method splits the string of numbers entered using whitespace or comma.
map(Number) converts an array of strings into a new array of numbers.
% operator returns the remainder of division.

In the for loop: Continue allows to skip the current iteration and continue the loop Break allows to break the loop and continue executing the next lines of code

Use of a boolean value that helps check if the number is a prime number.
Working concept: Iterating through each number in the given array, for each iteration, use a nested loop that loops from 2 to number-1 checking for the mod.
